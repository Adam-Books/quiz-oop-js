// There is some issues in this App:

// 1. All the answers is wrong... I don't Know why?
// 2. If The user did not choose any difficulty or The number of the questions, There is a message will tell him to enter The number of the questions or choose the difficulty... But the App will not wait & tries to fetch the questions!!!     [Adam Mohammed]
